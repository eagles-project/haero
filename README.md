# Haero: A High-Performance Modal Aerosol Model

Haero is a library that can be used to solve the modal aerosol equations in
order to analyze how aerosols form, grow, and interact with water vapor and
other elements in the Earth's atmosphere. Rather than providing a model to be
coupled in a specific way with other models, it provides a low-level application
programming interface (API) that allows you to construct your own coupling and
time-integrated methods.

The short-term goal of Haero is to provide an aerosol model for
[E3SM](https://github.com/E3SM-Project)'s state-of-the-science cloud-resolving
atmospheric model, [SCREAM](https://github.com/E3SM-Project/scream).

In addition to the Haero API, this repo also contains a standalone @ref driver
that can be used to easily set up and run simple column physics simulations. The
source for this driver lives in the `driver/` directory.

## Supported Platforms

You can build and run Haero on a Mac or Linux laptop or workstation. We
also support a limited number of platforms on which the Haero model is built and
tested:

* NERSC Cori
* Compy and Constance at PNNL

## Required Software

To build Haero, you need:

* [CMake v3.12+](https://cmake.org/)
* GNU Make
* reliable C and C++ compilers
* a good Fortran compiler, such as GNU `gfortran` or Intel's `ifort` compiler
* a working MPI installation (like [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) or
  [Mpich](https://www.mpich.org/)).

You can obtain all of these (except perhaps your favorite Fortran compiler)
freely on the Linux and Mac platforms. On Linux, just use your favorite package
manager. On a Mac, you can get the Clang C/C++ compiler by installing XCode, and
then use a package manager like [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) to get the rest.

For example, to download the relevant software on your Mac using Homebrew, type

```
brew install cmake gfortran openmpi
```

## Building the Model

To configure Haero:

1. Create a build directory by running the `setup` script from the top-level
   source directory:
   ```
   ./setup build
   ```
2. Change to your build directory and edit the `config.sh` file to select
   configuration options. Then run `./config.sh` to configure the model.
3. From the build directory, type `make -j` to build the library. (If you've
   configured your build for a GPU, place a number after the `-j` flag, as in
   `make -j 8`).
4. To run tests for the library (and the driver, if configured), type
   `make test`.
5. To install the model to the location indicated by `PREFIX` in your
   `config.sh` script, type `make install`. By default, products are installed
   in `include`, `lib`, `bin`, and `share` Ñ•ubdirectories within your build
   directory.

### Model subcomponents

The Haero library includes its basic library and interfaces as well as a standalone
driver for testing purposes.  These two components are separated into different
namespaces, @ref haero and @ref driver.


### Making code changes and rebuilding

This project uses **build trees** that are separate from source trees. This
is standard practice in CMake-based build systems, and it allows you to build
several different configurations without leaving generated and compiled files
all over your source directory. However, you might have to change the way you
work in order to be productive in this kind of environment.

When you make a code change, make sure you build from the build directory that
you created in step 1 above:

```
cd /path/to/haero/build
make -j
```

You can also run tests from this build directory with `make test`.

This is very different from how some people like to work. One method of making
this easier is to use an editor in a dedicated window, and have another window
open with a terminal, sitting in your `build` directory.

The build directory has a structure that mirrors the source directory, and you
can type `make` in any one of its subdirectories to do partial builds. In
practice, though, it's safest to always build from the top of the build tree.

## Generating Documentation

Documentation for Haero can be built using `make docs`. In order to build
documentation, you must install the following software:

* [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org/help/documentation/), for building
  Haero's technical documentation
* [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php), for converting images to
  the appropriate formats
* [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html), for generating the reference
  API documentation

All of these packages can be installed with a package manager like `apt` or
`homebrew`. For example, to install them on a Mac using `homebrew`:

```
brew install mactex imagemagick doxygen
```

Haero's documentation includes

* an extensive design document, which is built in the `docs/design` directory
  within your build directory. This document describes the aerosol modeling
  methodology used by Haero, as well as the library itself, and its various
  representations of aerosol processes

* HTML reference documentation for the Haero's C++/Fortran API, generated in
  the `docs/doxygen/html` directory within your build directory. You can point
  You can point your browser to `docs/html/index.html` to peruse the reference
  documentation.

# FAQ

## Building and Rebuilding

+ **When I run config.sh, I see an error complaining about a bad fd number!**
  You probably typed `sh config.sh` to run the configuration script. It's
  actually a `bash` script. Just type `./config.sh`.
+ **How do I "reconfigure my build"?** If you want to change a compile-time
  parameter in your model, you must reconfigure and rebuild it. To do this,
  edit your `config.sh` and change the parameter as needed. Then rerun it with
  `./config.sh`. After the script finishes, executing you can type `make -j` to
  rebuild the model.
+ **A pull request has the `reconfig required` label. What does this mean?**
  A pull request with the `reconfig required` label has made a change to the
  structure of the `config.sh` script, so you must rerun `setup <build_dir>`
  to regenerate your `config.sh` script. Once you've regenerated this script,
  you can reconfigure and build as usual.

## Programming for CPUs and GPUs with Kokkos

"Performance-portable" programming is a rich topic, fraught with complexity,
and deserves its [own special FAQ](https://github.com/jeff-cohere/haero/wiki/Cxx---Kokkos-Programming-FAQ)
on our [Wiki](https://github.com/jeff-cohere/haero/wiki).

## Testing

+ **Where are testing results stored when I type `make test`?** All testing
 results are logged to `Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log` within your build
 directory. A list of tests that failed is also written to `LastTestsFailed.log`
 in that same directory.

## Source Control and Repository

+ **Git thinks I have modifications in my submodules? Git submodules are
  annoying! Help!** We agree. These warnings about "dirty" modifications
  are irritating and useless. You can get rid of them by setting the
  following config parameter for Git:

  ```
  git config --global diff.ignoreSubmodules dirty
  ```
+ **Why must I clone the submodules for libraries that I already have installed
  locally? Git submodules are annoying! Help!** We agree. The submodule
  mechanism is a leaky abstraction and doesn't allow us to easily select which
  submodules should be cloned, so we just clone them all to keep things simple.
  We'll address this issue when a solution becomes more obvious.
