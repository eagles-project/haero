  # * The appropriate enumerated type that defines the role of the process
  #   within the aerosol life cycle (e.g. NucleationProcess for aerosol
  #   nucleation). For valid enum types, see ProcessType in haero/process.hpp.

  #   the .F90 suffix). The source code for this module must be located in a
  #   file named after the module, with an .F90 suffix. E.g.: mam_nucleation
  #   refers to a Fortran module named mam_nucleation whose source lives in
  #   mam_nucleation.F90, within this directory.
